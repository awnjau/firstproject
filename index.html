    <h1>Books I've Read in 2021</h1>
    <p>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong
      4.5/5 stars
      A beautifully written memoir detailing the trials and tribulations of being a gay Vietnamese man and son. You can easily tell he's a poet.His complicated relationship
      with his mother and his first love is raw and emotional. With outstanding prose and many quote-worthy moments, this book will leave you
      questioning your own upbringing.

    <p> A Court of Thorns and Roses(The First Three Books)by Sarah J Mass
      2/5 stars for the whole series
      The first book (ACOTAR), was boring and relatively uneventful. Your typical YA fantasy novel, not great not terrible. (3/5)
      The second book A Court of Mist and Fury(ACOMAF) was bad, simply awful. Both love interests suck ass, they're possessiveness is turned into
      romance and I hate how mental health was villanized. Also the main character is stupid.(1/5)
      The third book A Courth of Wings and Ruin (ACOWAR) was tiring. SJM must think herself a god to publish and book this big and this bad.
      It was confusing and everything about it was convoluted and unessecary. Also the performative feminism wasn't cute.(2/5)
