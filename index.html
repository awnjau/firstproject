    <p>4.5/5 stars</p>
    <p>A beautifully written memoir detailing the trials and tribulations of being a gay Vietnamese man and son. His complicated relationship
    with his mother and his first love is raw and emotional. With outstanding prose and many quote-worthy moments, this book will leave you
