    <h1>Books I've Read in 2021</h1>
    <p>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong<br>
      4.5/5 stars<br>
      A beautifully written memoir detailing the trials and tribulations of being a gay Vietnamese man and son. You can easily tell he's a poet.His complicated relationship
      with his mother and his first love is raw and emotional. With outstanding prose and many quote-worthy moments, this book will leave you
      questioning your own upbringing.

    <p>A Court of Thorns and Roses(The First Three Books)by Sarah J Mass<br>
      1.5/5 stars for the whole series
      The first book (ACOTAR), was boring and relatively uneventful. Your typical YA fantasy novel, not great not terrible. (3/5)<br>
      The second book A Court of Mist and Fury(ACOMAF) was bad, simply awful. Both love interests suck ass, they're possessiveness is turned into
      romance and I hate how mental health was villanized. Also the main character is stupid.(1/5)<br>
      The third book A Courth of Wings and Ruin (ACOWAR) was tiring. SJM must think herself a god to publish and book this big and this bad.
      It was confusing and everything about it was convoluted and unessecary. Also the performative feminism wasn't cute.(2/5)<br>

       The Lady Rogue by Jenn Bennett<br>
       3.5/5<br>
       It was a cute little read to have while on the vacation. Very reminiscent of Enola Holmes, which I did quite enjoy. I love the childhood friends to
       enemies to lovers trope, it gets me everytime. I was also really into fantasy at the time of reading it, so it definitely gave me the type of story I was looking for,
       but it's nothing special.

      Joyland by Steven King<br>
      4/5 stars<br>
      I actually quite liked this book. I was vitually stimulating and you could really get a sense of thie erie carnival world you've been thrust into. I thought the mystery
      aspect was done well, I didn't know what was going to happen so that was nice. I wasn't a big fan of the age gap relationship between the main character and that mom
      with the sick son, but the son was cute, definitely wierd and slightly creepy, but still cute.

      <p> The Eyes of the Dragon by Steven King<br>
          3/5 stars<br>
          I don't know how to feel about the fact that I'm a Steven King fan. This book was good. I don't know why I was obsessed with dragons at this time but whatever. It was a cute read,
          and I'm starting to realize that Steve is pretty good at giving visuals. But the mystery wasn't great; it was too obvious what the villan wanted. I hate when the chatacter is getting
          manipulated the whole time and they don't realize it.

        <p> We Were Liars by E Lockhart<br>
          2/5 stars<br>
          I'm no longer trusting booktok. This was shit, mostly because I had high expectations. If people didn't hype it up so much, it would've been a 2.5/5. The book is boring and
          all the characters suck and the twist is obvious if you've ever read "Every Last Word". I did find the portrayal of grief and survivors guilt intriging however. They
          could've done something.

        <p> Six of Crows(Duology)by Leigh Bardugo
           4.9/5 stars<br>
           I'm sorry but this series is great. Like honest to god the best fantasy/heist books I've ever read. I usually dislike series because they get worse as they go, but Leigh managed to
           pull a Shrek 2 and make a sequel that's just as great as the original. The book has everything. Action. A great cast of characters. Beautifully a written relationships and arcs. And a
           magic system that actually makes sense (SJM should take notes). I will say though, I some of the action scenes were very hard to imagine, so there's the 0.1 star.<br>
           Six of Crows 5/5<br>
           Crooked Kingdom 4.8/5
           </p>
           <p> They Both Die at the End by Adam Silvera<br>
             3/5 stars<br>
             Not gonna lie, it was a bit boring, especially towards the middle. At first I hated the multiple perspectives from people other than the two main characters, but when I finished the book
             I actually really enjoyed that aspect. Though giving it a 3 might be generous, seeing how all the stories connected in the end was something kinda beautiful. I also love the speculative design
             and how grounded in the real world it felt. Also the couple was cute and I can appreciate what it means to have a gay love story with two men of color.

             <p> Into the Crooked Place(Duology)by Alexandra Christo<br>
               2.5/5<br>
               Not a bad series nessecarily, but it felt like a bad ripoff of Six of Crows. I do like that one of the most important characters turned out to be two young black women, because that's not
               something you see in a lot of YA fantasy novels. And the sisterly relationship between the two of them was quite a nuanced one.

         <p> To Kill a Kingdom by Alexandra Christo<br>
                 3/5 stars<br>
                 I don't really understand what's so special about this book to begin with. Booktok loves it and my favorite youtuber who does book reviews also loves it, so I figured I should too. It's nice.
                 I like the world building and I do like the characters, and I even like the romance, there was just nothing about it that I absolutely loves. The whole thing was just "good". But the writting
                 is lyrically very whimsical, which I do like. The side chatacters are also fun.

                 <p>Domincana by Angie Cruz<br>
                   4/5 stars<br>
                   Detailing the journey of a young Dominican girl who is sent to America to live with her creepy older husband, Domincana was a breath of fresh air for me. After being submerged in booktok
                   reccomendations for quite some time, I was finally able to read something different. The book is written very personally, you can tell the story is close to Angie. I saw a lot of similarities
                   between Dominican culture and mine, especially with the attatchment to the idea of an "American dream". The story did get a bit tiresome in the middle, but it picked up pace again towards the end.
                  Overall, it was a really interesting read and I can't say I don't want to look at more of her work.

       <p> My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell<br>
                   4.5/5 stars<br>
                   Okay this book is fucked up, full discolsure. Well, not really the book itself, that's great, but more so what happens in the book. It details the story of a 15 year old girl who gets groomed
                   and abused by her 42 year old teacher at boarding school. In her eyes it's a romantic relationship, one where there's consent on both sides. It goes on to switch between her 15 year old self
                   and her current 32 year old self. And throughout all that time, she still kept in contact with him, that's how deeply he affected her. I could go on a full rant about this book, but no one wants to
                   read that so I'll just say that this book is so so so good at taking you into the mind of a young person who's being groomed. You really see how she was the perfect target and how manipulative
                   this man was to do that to her. It's doesn't romaticize the abuse, even though Vanessa herself does. It's clear in the world of the novel that no one agrees with her read that so I'll just say that this book is so so so good at taking you into the mind of a young person who's being groomed.
                   You really see how she was the perfect target and how manipulative this man was to do that to her. It's doesn't romaticize the abuse, even though Vanessa herself does. It's clear in the world of the novel that no one agrees with her when it comes to how her and
                   english teacher got into this situation. Don't read it if you have a weak stomach, or if these kinds of things are triggering. This was the last book I read and I have to say, I think it put me off reading
                   for a bit because of how hard it was to get through, but it was very thoughtfully written.
