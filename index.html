    <h1>Books I've Read in 2021</h1>
    <p>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong
      4.5/5 stars
      A beautifully written memoir detailing the trials and tribulations of being a gay Vietnamese man and son. You can easily tell he's a poet.His complicated relationship
      with his mother and his first love is raw and emotional. With outstanding prose and many quote-worthy moments, this book will leave you
      questioning your own upbringing.

    <p>A Court of Thorns and Roses(The First Three Books)by Sarah J Mass
      2/5 stars for the whole series
      The first book (ACOTAR), was boring and relatively uneventful. Your typical YA fantasy novel, not great not terrible. (3/5)
      The second book A Court of Mist and Fury(ACOMAF) was bad, simply awful. Both love interests suck ass, they're possessiveness is turned into
      romance and I hate how mental health was villanized. Also the main character is stupid.(1/5)
      The third book A Courth of Wings and Ruin (ACOWAR) was tiring. SJM must think herself a god to publish and book this big and this bad.
      It was confusing and everything about it was convoluted and unessecary. Also the performative feminism wasn't cute.(2/5)

       The Lady Rogue by Jenn Bennett
       3.5/5
       It was a cute little read to have while on the vacation. Very reminiscent of Enola Holmes, which I did quite enjoy. I love the childhood friends to
       enemies to lovers trope, it gets me everytime. I was also really into fantasy at the time of reading it, so it definitely gave me the type of story I was looking for,
       but it's nothing special.

      Joyland by Steven King
      4/5 stars
      I actually quite liked this book. I was vitually stimulating and you could really get a sense of thie erie carnival world you've been thrust into. I thought the mystery
      aspect was done well, I didn't know what was going to happen so that was nice. I wasn't a big fan of the age gap relationship between the main character and that mom
      with the sick son, but the son was cute, definitely wierd and slightly creepy, but still cute.
